## What is IkoBB? ##
IkoBB is a free and open source forum software. It is based on the forum software TangoBB

IkoBB is intended to be completely free in any way: 
* Freedom and very customizable in designing new themes
* Easy to add new plugins
* Open Source
* Community who supports in developing new themes


## Why is the name IkoBB? ##
TangoBB was named for a short time _IKO_. Due to the fact that we are still TangoBB fork we want to show that we are connected with TangoBB. But we won't fork back to TangoBB.
This will stay a independent open source project which wants to go it's own way.

## We need you! ##
