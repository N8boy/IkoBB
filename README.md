## IkoBB ##
IkoBB is a fork of the forum software TangoBB. We try to create a very customizable forum software, which can be used for any purpose.
 With it's unique style system you can edit your theme direct from the ACP so small fixes or even big changes can be done easily.
 
## Why is the name IkoBB? ##
TangoBB was named for a short time _IKO_. Due to the fact that we are still TangoBB fork we want to show that we are connected with TangoBB. But we won't fork back to TangoBB.
This will stay a independent open source project which wants to go it's own way.
